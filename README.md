# tert_TRAP_TEN

This repository contains python scripts used to isolate sequences of the TEN and TRAP domains from  
full-length telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) sequences. 
  
The scripts directory contains the python scripts necessary to isolate the TRAP and TEN domains  
from full-length sequences in the SEQUENCES directory. Additional files are for the analysis of  
any secondary structure prediction or disorder prediction performed on isolated sequences.
